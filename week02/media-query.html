            <h2>Doctrine and Covenants 6:22-23</h2>
            <p>22 Verily, verily, I say unto you, if you desire a further witness, cast your mind upon the night that you cried unto me in your heart, that you might know concerning the truth of these things.

                23 Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter? What greater witness can you have than from God?</p>

            <p>Now, concerning the state of the soul between death and the resurrectionâ€”Behold, it has been made known unto me by an angel, that the spirits of all men, as soon as they are departed from this mortal body, yea, the spirits of all men, whether they be good or evil, are taken home to that God who gave them life.</p>
